"""
Thread package for managing model training and unlearning operations.

This package provides thread classes that handle the actual computation for training
and various unlearning methods. Each thread runs independently and provides status tracking.

Available threads:
    TrainingThread: Handles model training operations
    UnlearningGAThread: Unlearning using gradient ascent method
    UnlearningRLThread: Unlearning using random labeling method
    UnlearningFTThread: Unlearning using fine-tuning method
    UnlearningRetrainThread: Unlearning by retraining from scratch
    UnlearningCustomThread: Custom unlearning method for inference

Each thread class follows a similar pattern:
1. Inherits from threading.Thread
2. Takes model, data, and optimization components as input
3. Implements run() method for the main computation loop
4. Provides methods for status updates and graceful termination
