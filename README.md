## Features

### Built-in Baseline Methods
The Machine Unlearning Comparator provides comparison of various baseline methods:
- Fine-Tuning
- Gradient-Ascent
- Random-Labeling

### **Custom Method Integration** âœ¨
**Upload and evaluate your own unlearning methods!** The comparator supports custom implementations, enabling you to:
- **Benchmark** your novel approaches against established baselines
- **Upload** your custom unlearning implementations for comparison
- **Compare** results using standardized evaluation metrics and privacy attacks

It includes various visualizations and evaluations through privacy attacks to assess the effectiveness of each method.
