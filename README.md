## Features

### Built-in Baseline Methods
The Machine Unlearning Comparator provides comparison of various baseline methods:
- **Fine-Tuning**: Leverages catastrophic forgetting by fine-tuning the model on remaining data with increased learning rate
- **Gradient-Ascent**: Moves in the direction of increasing loss for forget samples using negative gradients
- **Random-Labeling**: Fine-tunes the model by randomly reassigning labels for forget samples, excluding the original forget class labels

### **Custom Method Integration** âœ¨
**Upload and evaluate your own unlearning methods!** The comparator supports custom implementations, enabling you to:
- **Benchmark** your novel approaches against established baselines
- **Upload** your custom unlearning implementations for comparison
- **Compare** results using standardized evaluation metrics and privacy attacks

It includes various visualizations and evaluations through privacy attacks to assess the effectiveness of each method.
